Description: This package aims to integrate GWAS-derived SNPs and coexpression
    networks to mine candidate genes associated with a particular phenotype.
    For that, users must define a set of guide genes, which are known genes 
    involved in the studied phenotype. Additionally, the mined candidates can
    be given a score that favor candidates that are hubs and/or transcription
    factors. The scores can then be used to rank and select the top n most
    promising genes for downstream experiments.
