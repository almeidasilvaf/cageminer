The goal of `cageminer` is to integrate SNP data from GWAS results with gene coexpression networks to identify high-confidence candidate genes involved in a particular phenotype.

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `cageminer` using from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) the following code:

```{r 'install', eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("cageminer")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/almeidasilvaf/cageminer) with:

```{r 'install_dev', eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("almeidasilvaf/cageminer")
```
